1) first ssh with this linux server "ssh tanvir@192.168.0.100"
2) then update the package manager "sudo apt update"
or
=> sudo yum update
3) install the mysql server "sudo apt install mysql-server -y"
4) start  service "sudo systemctl start mysql"
5) enable service "sudo systemctl enable mysql"
6) chck the status "sudo systemctl status mysql"
7) enter the mysql with sudo previliges "sudo mysql"
8) alter the user table for setting up root users password
   we are going to change the authentication method to
   mysql_native_password
sql is: "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';"
in the password sectio give your password

9) then exit "mysql> exit";

10) run "sudo mysql_secure_installation"
    1) ask for the root password : <password>
    2) ask for enable the password validator setup. you should do it 
       for security. for now i can give no. it is recommended to give it
    3) Chnge the password for root. for now i give no. do it if you want to do it
    4) Remove anonymous users? YES. by default mysql installation has 
       anonymous users.remove it
    5) Disallow root login remotely: Yes. it is recomended . 
    6) Remove test database and acesss to it: Yes;
    7) Reload privileges tables. Yes
    
11) edit the configuraton file:
    => sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
    
    commented the following line
    bind-address = 127.0.0.1
    to
    #bind-address = 127.0.0.1

12) restart the service
    => sudo systemctl restart mysql

13) enter the data base as a root user
    => mysql -u root -p 

14) Create users. which credentials will be used fro remote server
    now:
    VVVVVI:
    suppose you want to create a user 
    
    username: tanvir
    Ip address: of client[not server ,client] is : 192.168.0.3
    password: 1122
    Then create the user like that.
    1) first create the user
       >USE mysql;
       ### CREATE USER 'user'@'ip_client' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
       >CREATE USER 'tanvir'@'192.168.0.3' IDENTIFIED BY '1122'
    2) give permission to that newly created user
       give permission to database you need. 
       in this example i give all permission to this user
       
       > GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'tanvir'@'192.168.0.3';
    
    3) Rreload the changes
       > FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


15) Mysql server use the port : 3306 port. allow port to the fire wall
    => sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp;
    => sudo ufw reload
or if centos:	
    =>sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3307/tcp --permanent
=>   sudo firewall-cmd --reload

## thats the end of the server configuration
## go to the client portion

1) in linux : open terminal and use this command

    => mysql -h [server_address] -u [username] -p <password>
    => mysql -h 192.168.0.100 -u tanvir -p 1122

2) or open up mysql-workbench and use this credentias to access the data;
