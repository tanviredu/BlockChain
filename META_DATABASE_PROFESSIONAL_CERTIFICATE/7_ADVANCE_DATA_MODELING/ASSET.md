DATA MODELING:
	DATA MODEL PROVIDES VISUAL DIAGRAM AND RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER.
3 LEVEL DATA MODELS:

1) CONCEPTUAL MODEL
2) LOGICAL MODEL
3) PHYSICAL MODEL

DATABASE ANNOMALY:
1) INSERTION ANOMALY
2) UPDATE ANNOMALY
3) DELETION ANOMOLY


FORWARD ENGINEERING MODEL WITH MYSQL WORKBENCH
REVERSE ENGINEERING MODEL WITH MYSQL WORKBENCH

DATA WHEREHOUSE:
DIMENSIONAL MODEL

WHAT IS DATA WAREHOUSE:
CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY THAT AGGRAGATES,INTEGRATES,STORES AND PROCESS LARGE AMMUNTS OF DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES

DATA WHEREHOUSE:
1) IS SUBJECT ORIENTED
2) IS INTEGRATED
3) IS NON VOLATILE
4) IS TIME VARIENT

DATA WAREHOUSE ARCHITECTURE 

1) DATA SOURCE
2) DATA STAGING
3) DATA WAREHOUSE
4) DATA MARTS


DIMENSIONAL DATA MODELING
BASED IN DIMENSIONS AND FACTS

IT USES SNOWFLAKW SCHEMA

2 TYPES OF DATA 
1) NUMERIC DATA QUANTITATIVE
2) NON NUMERIC QUALITATIVE DATA


DATA MINING:
PROCESS OF FINDING PATTERN IN DATA


DATA MODELING:
THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF DATA ELEMENTS AND THEIR RELATIONSIP

ENTITY LAVEL DIAGRAM:
1) CONCEPTUAL DATA MODEL (ENTITY MODEL)
PURPOSE: HIGH LEVEL REPRESENTATION
IT SHOWS BASIC OF LOGICAL DATA MODEL

2) LOGICAL DATA MODEL (IT DEFINES THE PROPERTY AND DEFINE THE FOREIGN KEY AND PRIMARY KEY) MUST INCLUDE ALL ATTRIBUTE AND WHICH COLUMN SERVE AS PRIMARY KEY AND WHICH IS FOREIGN KEY THAT USES FOR RELATIONSHIP

3)PHYSICAL DATA MODEL MUST HAVE DATA TYPE CONSTRATINTS AND ATTRINUTE. PHYSICAL DATA MODEL IS MORE DETAILED THAN LOGICAL MODEL
IN LOGICAL MODEL YOU DONT NEED A DATA TYPE OR CONSTRAINTS OF THE ATTRIBUTE BUT IN PHYSICAL MODEL IT DOES NEEDED.

DATA MODEL:
	1) RELATIONAL DATA MODEL
	2) ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DATA MODEL
	3) HIARARCHICAL DATA MODEL
	4) DIMENSIONAL DATA MODEL
	5) OBJECT ORIENTATED DATA MODEL

1) RELATIONAL DATA BASE:
	PRESENTS THE DATA IN ROW AND COLUMN (TABULAR FORMAT)

	3 TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP
		1) 1-1 RELATIONSHIP
		2) 2-MANY RELATIONSHIP
		3) MANY-MANY RELATIONSHIP
2) ER DATA MODEL:
	1) EACH TABLE IS CONSIDERED SEPARATE ENTITY
	2) ALSO HAS 1-1 1-* AND *-* RELATIONSHIP

3) HIARARCHICAL DATA MODEL:
	ORGANIZE THE DATA LIKE A TREE OR PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP

	ONLY PARENT TO CHILD RELATIONSHIP 1-MANY RELATIONSHIP IS POSSIBLE. MULTIPLE CHILD ENTITY ONLY BELINGS TO A SINGLE PARENT ENTITY
	LIKE:
		SALES   => STAFF,CLIENTS
		CLIENTS => ADDRESS,ORDERS
		ORDERS  => PRODUCT,DELIVERY

		ITS LIKE A TREE RELATIONSHIP

4) OOP MODEL:
	BASED ON OOP CONCEPT
	1) EACH ELEMENT REPRESENTS AS CLASS
	2) RELY ON INHERITANCE VERY MUCH
	3) ONE TO MANY , MANY TO MANY, AND ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP IS POSSIBLE WITH PROPERTIES
	LIKE THIS

	CLASS PERSON:
		ID,
		FULL_NAME
		CONTACT_NUMBER

	CLASS STAFF EXTENDS PERSON:
		STAFFID
		SALARY

	CLIENT EXTENDS PERSON:
		CIENTID
		TYPE


STAFF AND CLIENT HAS A "IS A" RELATION WITH PERSON



5) DIMENSIONAL MODEL ( DIMENSIONAL DATA MODEL IS BETTER FOR FAST DATA RETRIVAL AND DATA ANALYSIS)
	DEPENDS ON 2 THINGS:
		1) MEASUREMENT 
		2) FACTS
